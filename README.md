# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Setting Up the Database

If you do not already have a MongoDB Atlas account, create one at https://www.mongodb.com/.

Create a new project and navigate to the Clusters tab under DATA STORAGE. Click the "Create a New Cluster" button and choose a provider for your database (currently, the app has only been tested with AWS) and create your cluster.

Return to the Clusters page and click on the CONNECT button for your newly created cluster. 

On the "Setup connection security" step, you may want to specify 0.0.0.0/0 as a connection address to simplify access through various networks. Additionally, remember to save your username and passwrod for the cluster.

Once on the "Choose a connection method" step, select the "Connect your application" option. From there, choose "Node.js" as the driver and "3.6 or later" as the version. Copy the provided connection string to your clipboard.

Within the main folder of the project, create a file called ".env" and within it initialize a variable called DB_CONNECTION_STRING to be the string you copied from MongoDB. An example .env file would look like this (all on one line):

DB_CONNECTION_STRING = "mongodb+srv://username:password@schemedata.zculb.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

Make sure to substitute in your cluster username and password into the string.

After this step, the database should be ready for use.


## Technology

Our app uses MongoDB as a backend and consequently uses the Mongoose API to interact with the database.
